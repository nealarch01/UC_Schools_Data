# UC_Schools_Data
Getting data of each UC school saved in json format
To run index.ts you will need to have TypeScript and ts-node installed


run command: ``` ts-node index.ts ```
alternatively: ``` tsc index.ts; node index.js```

**You need to have a config.json file in your local directory**
My formatting for config.json:
```
{
  "API_KEY": "your_api_key"
}
```
